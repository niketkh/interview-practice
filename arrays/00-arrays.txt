-> Kth smallest element [or Kth largest element] ***
	[Use Selection / Bubble Sort - O(n*k)
	or Use Sorting techniques like Heap Sort or Merge Sort or Quick Sort - O(nlogn)
	or Use Min Heap - O(n + klogn)
	or Use Max Heap - O(k + (n-k) * logk + klogk)
	or Use Oder Statistics 
	or Use Quick Sort Partition to find Kth largest then sort k-1 elements - O(n + klogk)]

-> Get K smallest elements [or Get K largest elements]
	[Use Selection / Bubble Sort - O(n*k)
	OR Use Sorting techniques like Heap Sort or Merge Sort or Quick Sort - O(nlogn)
	OR Use Min Heap - O(n + klogn)
	OR Use Max Heap - O(k + (n-k) * logk)
	OR Use Quick Sort Partition to find Kth largest - O(n)]

-> Kth largest element in stream ***
	[Use Min Heap - O(k + (n-k) * logk)]

-> Trapping Rain Water ***
	[For each element, find highest bars on the left and right; Take smaller of two heights; 
	Diff between smaller height and height of current elment gives amount of water that can be stored - O(n^2)
	OR Precompute highest left and right bars for each bar in left and right arrays and 
	   use it to calculate amount of water trapped - O(n)
	OR Maintain two variables for leftMax and rightMax, 
	   since water trapped at any element is min(leftMax, rightMax) - currentElement - O(n)]
