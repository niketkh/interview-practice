/*
	Initialize a variable currentSum as first element. 
	currentSum indicates the sum of current subarray. 
	Start from the second element and add all elements one by one to the currentSum. 
	If currentSum becomes equal to sum, then print the solution. 
	If currentSum exceeds the sum, then remove trailing elements while currentSum is greater than sum.
